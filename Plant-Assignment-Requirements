Create a ‘Plant’ class that extends EventEmitter
The ‘Plant’ class show have two variables:
size - a number
hasBeenPlanted - a boolean
An instantiated plant object should respond to 4 events
The ‘plantSeed’ event should set the plant’s size to 1 and set hasBeenPlanted to true, only the first time it is emitted
The ‘water’ and ‘bugAttack’ events should:
Increase and decrease the plant’s size respectively every time they are emitted, as long as the seed has already been planted
Print out an error if the seed has not yet been planted
The ‘harvest’ event should print out the current size of the plant and remove all listeners from the plant


myPlant.emit('harvest');
myPlant.emit('bugAttack');
myPlant.emit('plantSeed');
myPlant.emit('water');
myPlant.emit('bugAttack');
myPlant.emit('error', new Error('whoops!'));
myPlant.emit('water');
myPlant.emit('water');
myPlant.emit('water');
myPlant.emit('plantSeed');
myPlant.emit('harvest');
myPlant.emit('water');
myPlant.emit('bugAttack');
myPlant.emit('bugAttack');
